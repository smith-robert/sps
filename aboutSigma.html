      <h3>UCF CHAPTER OF SIGMA PI SIGMA (ΣΠΣ)</h3>
		<hr>
        <h3><small>Constitution Guidelines and Bylaws</small></h3>
		
        <h5 id="art1"> ARTICLE I: NAME </h5> 
        <p>The name of this organization shall be “Chapter of the Sigma Pi Sigma at the University of Central Florida”.</p>

        <h5 id="art2"> ARTICLE II: PREAMBLE </h5>
			<p>The purpose of this Chapter shall be:</p>
			<ul class="square">
      				<li>to serve as a means of awarding distinction to students having high scholarship and promise of achievement in physics</li>
					<li>to promote student interest in research and the advanced study of the science</li> 
					<li>to encourage a professional spirit and friendship among those who have displayed marked ability in physics</li> 
					<li>to popularize interest in physics in the general college public.</li>      
			</ul>

        <h5 id="art3"> ARTICLE III: ADMINISTRATION </h5>
        <p>The Chapter is run by a committee made of three members. The members of the committee are selected from among those Faculty of the Physics Department who have strong interest in the Undergraduate Curriculum and Undergraduate Physics Education. One of the three members shall be the advisor of the SPS UCF Chapter unless he elects not to do so. The committee will select new members according to the eligibility criteria. If it decides, the committee may appoint three officers (a President, a Secretary, and a Treasurer) to assist with the daily administration of the Chapter.</p> 
        
        <h5 id="art4">ARTICLE IV: SELECTION OF NEW MEMBERS</h5>

				<ul class="square">
      				<li>The student has junior status in any major.</li>
      				<li>The student has taken at least three courses (that can be counted for the physics major) from the UCF Physics Department course offerings.</li>
      				<li> The student has at least 9 credit hours at 3000-level in physics courses taken at UCF or officially transferred from another university.</li>
					<li>The student has an overall minimum GPA of 3.0 and a Physics minimum GPA of 3.5.</li>
    			</ul>

  			<h6>B. Graduate Students</h6>
				<p>Any graduate student enrolled at UCF (from the Department of Physics or other Departments) may request membership in the Chapter. The Committee may also nominate students to become members. In all such cases, a positive decision will be made if the student satisfies the following criteria:</p>
				<ul class="square">
  					<li>The student has at least 12 credit hours of core physics graduate courses. Courses transferred officially from other universities as ‘core courses’ count in the calculation of credit hours.</li>
  					<li>The student has a minimum GPA of 3.75 calculated from the core physics grad- uate courses.</li>
					<li>Graduate research and independent study may not be counted in the calculation of credit hours or GPA.</li>
				</ul>
			<h6>C. Transfer Members</h6>
				<p> Members of other Sigma Pi Sigma Chapters can transfer their membership to the UCF Chapter with the Committee’s approval. </p>
			<h6>D. Honorary Members</h6>
				<p> The Committee can elect new honorary members at any time.</p>
			<h6>E. Other Regular Members</h6>
